# openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli

Command line tool to generate Hash-Ids based on XML/JSON EPCIS document provided.

### Introduction:

This command line tool generates the Hash Ids for EPCIS documents in JSON/XML format using the project the `openepcis-event-hash-generator` (ref: https://github.com/openepcis/openepcis-event-hash-generator).

By requiring only a few simple command-line inputs, this utility simplifies it for users to produce Hash Ids for EPCIS documents. It accepts numerous arguments and performs various operations.


### Accepted Parameters:

The program accepts a number of parameters that are supplied using the simple alphabet. The different acceptable parameters and their values are listed below:

`-h`: denotes "help," when used will provide all acceptable arguments along with their descriptions.

`-a`: denotes "algorithm", It indicates the kind of algorithm that must be produced by the tool. Sha-1, Sha-224, Sha-256, Sha-384, Sha-512, Sha3-224, Sha3-256, Sha3-384, Sha3-512, MD2 and MD5 are all acceptable values. default: SHA-256.

`-e`: denotes the "enforced format", It describes the type of EPCIS document that has been provided. It is essential to indicate the document type since XML and JSON documents are handled in different ways. JSON and XML are accepted values. Default: JSON and can be identified based on the file format automatically.

`-p`: denotes the "pre-hash", It is a string created utilizing the EPCIS event information and used to create the Hash Id. It instructs if the pre-hash string should be printed 
or not. Upon request, the pre-hash string for each event will be displayed.

`-b`: denotes the "batch", It gives instructions on whether to write the pre-hash string and Hash ids to the file. If provided then all event pre-hashes and their 
corresponding Hash-ids will be written into two separate files.

`-j`: denotes the "join". It's easy to beautify the pre-hash string by indicating whether to attach a certain string to the pre-hash. It could be simpler to discern between distinct properties in a pre-hash text to troubleshoot problems If you add a new line (\n) or a tab character (\t). By default, no additional characters are added to the pre-hash string.


### Usage:

After cloning the application/GitHub repositories to the local system run the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```
The above command will create the JAR (Java ARchive) of the application in the root/target folder, It is a file format for packages that are frequently used to group together a lot of Java class files and related information.

The general command that may be used to create hash IDs for the EPCIS document located within the remote URL is as follows:
```
java -jar path-of-jar-file/name-of-jar-file -a hash-algorithm-type url-for-epcis-document
```

### Example commands:
1. To access every help command available in the tool, use the command below:
```
java -jar target/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
```

2. The following command will only construct hash-ids for the EPCIS document in the remote URL:
```
java -jar target/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  -e XML -a sha1-224 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gs1/EPCIS/master/XML/AssociationEvent/AssociationEventExamples.xml
```

3. The following command will generate remote URL hash-ids for EPCIS documents and display the pre-hash string:
```
java -jar target/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -e XML -a sha3-512 -p https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gs1/EPCIS/master/XML/AssociationEvent/AssociationEventExamples.xml
```

4. The following command will generate hash IDs for EPCIS documents at a remote URL and write the hash IDs and pre-hash strings to a file:
```
java -jar target/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -e XML -a sha3-512 -b https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gs1/EPCIS/master/XML/AssociationEvent/AssociationEventExamples.xml
```

5. The following command will create hash ids for remote EPCIS documents and will also append a new line character to a pre-hash text:
 ```
java -jar target/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -e XML -a md2 -p -j \\n https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gs1/EPCIS/master/XML/AssociationEvent/AssociationEventExamples.xml
```

6. Create hash IDs for EPCIS documents in the local directory using the following command, and add a new line character to the pre-hash string:
```
java -jar target/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -e JSON -a sha3-384 -p -j \\n /Users/aravinda.baligab/GitHub/openepcis-event-hash-generator-cli/jsonFile.json
```
